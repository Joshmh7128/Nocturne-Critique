# Introduction
This is the homepage for everything related to the Nocturne Technical & Design Critique written up by Josh Hirshfield, starting on January 4th, 2024. Pages will be linked to one another when deemed relatable using MediaWiki local links. Specifically double square bracket: [[]], and tagged ex: #nocturne, #outpost4  for local markdown clients i.e. Obsidian.

All that being said, this entire wiki will be accessible and hosted on GitHub by Josh for the remainder of the project, and can be downloaded by anyone with access.

## Tone, Writing, and Psychological Safety
For the sake of the critique I've been asked to go in depth and treat this as if it is a final thesis project of one of my students. I'll be writing critically in this document to ensure that I cover all aspects of the game both from a technical and design standpoint, and at any of the junctures at which those points crossover.

When writing in this style my writing may come off as grating or direct. Assuming the context in which this is being written is for others who are design oriented, I will be writing it directly sandwiching techniques. However it is important to note that I have the utmost respect for everyone on the project. 

As with all critique we should be open to reviewing the negative aspects of our work, and feel secure delivering the same critique. Throughout this I will be critical of the systems others have built, not the members themselves. In that same light, I hope that respect is reflected. 

While I don't doubt in the abilities of the team so far at Outpost 4, I am writing this section in as an additional precautionary for those who may adopt this project, wiki, code, and design in the future. The language used in this must be taken into context of why it is being written, rather than simply as boilerplate text on "how to make your game good."
## Writing Perspectives and Critique Types
### Summary
Critique in this Wiki will take three major forms, listed below. The goal of this is to contextualize and diversify the kinds of feedback and resulting output, changes, and refactoring that comes of it. In addition to the psychological context of this wiki, the perspective will drive the design process just as directly. 
### Foundational Critique
**This project will not succeed unless...**
When I tag something with #foundational-critique, it means that this is fundamental to the success of the project. That above all, if this is not fixed, the project may never make it out alive. This will be reserved extensively to areas of the project which I feel need extreme attention. Consider this a giant red flag billowing in the wind.
### Actionable Critique
**You can...**
While Foundational Critique is focused mainly on aspects of the projects which are fundamental to its success, #actionable-critique is focused on actionable items which could be chosen as a focus for project improvement. Some of these may not be achievable within the project timeframe.

While these critique items may not necessarily align directly with the projects goals and directives at the time, they will serve as a great jumping-off point for members picking this project back up in the future. Pointing to these three, six, or even twelve months later to say, we know what we *wanted* do to improve this project, is a great way to then say: *What do we want to do with this project **now?***

Some Actionable Critique items may be things which can be implemented going forward, such as types of communication or work-habits. Doing these will continue to benefit the project going forward and can be integrated without refactoring.
### Subjective Critique
**If this were my project...**
Of the critique types, this one should be taken with the most malleability, to the degree that if one were in a rush or only focusing on a specific area, they may ignore it. #subjective-critique can best be described as: *If we had unlimited time and unlimited energy, it would be great.*

Unfortunately, we don't, and won't. The point of adding in this critique is to build a volume of post-mortem information. Using these subjective critiques during a retrospective is a great way to say: *On our last project we weren't able to implement X, but if we plan correctly, can we implement it on our next one?*
